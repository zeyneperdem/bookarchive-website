        <p class="description">
            with humor and levity, here adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. she shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike.

        <p class="review-text">A short, insightful essay about a topic I am incredibly passionate about: feminism. I was practically nodding my head the entire time as so much of what was brought forth hit home. However, I had a few issues with heteronormative and cisnormative language. I don't believe she was being intentionally exclusionary, so I'm interested to read her newest feminist essay in the near future!</p>
